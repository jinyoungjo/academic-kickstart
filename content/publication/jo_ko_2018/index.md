abstract: The present study investigates Korean mothers’ use of sound symbolism, in
  particular expressive lengthening and ideophones, in their speech directed to their
  children. Specifically, we explore whether the frequency and acoustic saliency of
  sound symbolic words are modulated by the maturity of children’s linguistic ability.
  A total of 36 infant-mother dyads, 12 each belonging to the three groups of preverbal
  (M = 8-month-old), early speech (M = 13-month-old), and multiword (M = 27-month-old)
  stage, were recorded in a 40-min free-play session. The results were consistent
  with the findings in previous research that the ratio of sound symbolic words in
  mothers’ speech decreases with child age and that they are acoustically more salient
  than conventional words in duration and pitch measures. We additionally found that
  mothers weaken the prominence for ideophones for older children in mean pitch, suggesting
  that such prominence of these iconic words might bootstrap infants’ word learning
  especially when they are younger. Interestingly, however, we found that mothers
  maintain the acoustic saliency of expressive lengthening consistently across children’s
  ages in all acoustic measures. There is some indication that children at age 2 are
  not likely to have mastered the fine details of scalar properties in certain words.
  Thus, it could be that they still benefit from the enhanced prosody of expressive
  lengthening in learning the semantic attributes of scalar adjectives, and, accordingly,
  mothers continue to provide redundant acoustic cues longer for expressive lengthening
  than ideophones.
